be checked against reality (statistics, events, quotes attributed to people, historical facts,
scientific claims, predictions stated as fact, etc.). Do not include pure opinions, jokes, or
purely subjective statements as claims.

For each claim, quote the EXACT line(s) from the manuscript verbatim (character-for-character,
without the leading timestamp), and separately state the specific, checkable claim being made in
clear terms.
